# Product Context: Online Card Show

## Why This Project Exists
The trading card and collectibles market has grown significantly in recent years, but existing platforms like eBay lack specialized features for this niche. Online Card Show aims to fill this gap by providing a purpose-built marketplace specifically designed for trading cards and collectibles, offering superior tools, lower fees, and a community-focused experience.

## Problems It Solves

### For Buyers
- Difficulty finding authentic, well-described collectibles on general marketplaces
- Lack of standardized condition grading and authentication
- High fees and uncertain seller reliability on existing platforms
- Limited tools for collection management and wishlist tracking

### For Sellers
- High commission rates on general marketplaces cutting into profits
- Limited listing options for properly showcasing collectibles
- Challenges in reaching the right audience for specialized items
- Inadequate inventory management tools for large collections
