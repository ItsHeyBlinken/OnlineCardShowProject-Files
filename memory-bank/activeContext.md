# Active Context: Online Card Show

## Current Work Focus
The project is in its initial setup phase. We are currently establishing the foundation for both frontend and backend components of the application. The focus is on setting up the project structure, defining the database schema, and preparing the development environment.

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Set up basic frontend and backend directories
- Defined initial database schema (DataBase_Schema.csv)
- Installed core dependencies
- Created README with project overview

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up API structure with Express.js
   - Implement database models based on schema
   - Create authentication system (JWT-based)
   - Develop core API endpoints for users, listings, and transactions

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Design and implement component structure
   - Create responsive layouts for main pages
   - Develop authentication UI flows
   - Build marketplace browsing experience

3. **Database Implementation**:
   - Set up database connections
   - Implement schema migrations
   - Create seed data for development

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Configure development, staging, and production environments
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines
   - Implement logging and monitoring

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Evaluating payment gateway options (Stripe vs PayPal vs custom solution)
- Considering implementation approaches for the subscription model
- Researching best practices for high-resolution image handling
- Exploring options for search optimization for collectible items
- Deciding on the authentication flow and user onboarding experience
- Evaluating approaches for scalable deployment
