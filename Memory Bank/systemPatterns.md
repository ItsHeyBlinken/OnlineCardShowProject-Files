# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Full-stack application with separated frontend and backend
- Frontend: React-based single-page application (SPA)
- Backend: Node.js with Express REST API
- Database: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- JWT-based authentication system
- RESTful API design pattern

## Key Technical Decisions
- React for frontend to enable dynamic user interface
- Node.js/Express for scalable backend architecture
- PostgreSQL for reliable relational data storage
- JWT for stateless authentication
- bcrypt for secure password hashing
- CORS enabled for secure cross-origin requests
- Environment-based configuration using dotenv

## Design Patterns
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in backend
- Component-based architecture in React frontend
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Middleware pattern for authentication and validation
- Observer pattern for state management
- Factory pattern for data models
- Singleton pattern for database connection
